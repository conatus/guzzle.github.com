    <n>
* Bug: Custom delay time calculations are no longer ignored in the ExponentialBackoffPlugin
* Added the ability to transfer entity bodies as a string rather than streamed. This gets around curl error 65. Set `body_as_string` in a request's curl options to enable.
* Added a StreamInterface, EntityBodyInterface, and added ftell() to Guzzle\Common\Stream
* Added an AbstractEntityBodyDecorator and a ReadLimitEntityBody decorator to transfer only a subset of a decorated stream
* Stream and EntityBody objects will now return the file position to the previous position after a read required operation (e.g. getContentMd5())
* Added additional response status codes
* Removed SSL information from the default User-Agent header
* DELETE requests can now send an entity body
* Added an EventDispatcher to the ExponentialBackoffPlugin and added an ExponentialBackoffLogger to log backoff retries
* Added the ability of the MockPlugin to consume mocked request bodies
* LogPlugin now exposes request and response objects in the extras array
