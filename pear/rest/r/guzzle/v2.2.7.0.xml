    <n>
* BC: Inflection classes moved to Guzzle\Inflection. No longer static methods. Can now inject custom inflectors into classes.
* BC: Removed magic setX methods from commands
* BC: Magic methods mapped to service description commands are now inflected in the command factory rather than the client __call() method
* Verbose cURL options are no longer enabled by default. Set curl.debug to true on a client to enable.
* Bug: Now allowing colons in a response start-line (e.g. HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable: Back-end server is at capacity)
* Guzzle\Service\Resource\ResourceIteratorApplyBatched now internally uses the Guzzle\Common\Batch namespace
* Added Guzzle\Service\Plugin namespace and a PluginCollectionPlugin
* Added the ability to set POST fields and files in a service description
* Guzzle\Http\EntityBody::factory() now accepts objects with a __toString() method
* Adding a command.before_prepare event to clients
* Added BatchClosureTransfer and BatchClosureDivisor
* BatchTransferException now includes references to the batch divisor and transfer strategies
* Fixed some tests so that they pass more reliably
* Added Guzzle\Common\Log\ArrayLogAdapter
