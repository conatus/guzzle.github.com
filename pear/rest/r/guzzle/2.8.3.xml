    <n>
* Bug: Fixed a case where empty POST requests were sent as GET requests
* Bug: Fixed a bug in ExponentialBackoffPlugin that caused fatal errors when retrying an EntityEnclosingRequest that does not have a body
* Bug: Setting the response body of a request to null after completing a request, not when setting the state of a request to new
* Added multiple inheritance to service description commands
* Added an ApiCommandInterface and added ``getParamNames()`` and ``hasParam()``
* Removed the default 2mb size cutoff from the Md5ValidatorPlugin so that it now defaults to validating everything
* Changed CurlMulti::perform to pass a smaller timeout to CurlMulti::executeHandles
